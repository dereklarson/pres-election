# Many thanks to the prior work:
Derived from https://github.com/tonmcg/County_Level_Election_Results_12-16.git

This expands on that through some further data cleaning, handling of census data, and sample analyses.

# To run
Place in your favorite iPython / Jupyter notebook environment.

If you don't have one, get [Docker](http://docker.com) and clone the Jupyter/docker-stats repo.
Build up to the scipy-notebook image, which is then used by the script:
```
./run-notebook.sh
